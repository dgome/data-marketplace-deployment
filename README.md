### Data Marketplace Deployment (WIP2)

This repository contains the manifests to deploy Kafka, kafka rest proxy (with modified configuration), elastic search, traefic.
It is also used for our pipeline with the kubeconfig file. In your real environment you should keep it private because it contains sensitive data about your kubernetes configuration.
